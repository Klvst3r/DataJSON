We have a disclosed in our previus area, we take a debate to interchange format so data that is send from the server and will be consumed by that line

So that well be sent in the form of and object and that object will be in the form of the stream tht will be a decend stream that will need to be passed to convert in into a JavsScript Object

So for converting adjacent string to javascript object we ned to use a method that is called parse

So lest make the clean 


<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="ntf-8">
	<title>Example using JSON Object</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="demo"></div>
	<script tyoe="text/javascript">

		var myJSONString = '{ "name":"vatan", "age":"30", "city":"New York" }';

		var myObj = JSON.parse(myJSONString);

		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name + " " + myObj.age + " " + myObj.city;

	</script> 
</body>
</html>


We passed the string and we first one by one in the jvascrpt object to pse method is used to pass  the string that is returned from the word
